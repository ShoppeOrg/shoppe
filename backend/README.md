## Prerequisites

- move to `backend` root folder
- create `.env` file inside root folder with following variables:

```
    SENDGRID_API_KEY=
    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=
    DJANGO_DEBUG=
    PASSWORDLESS_EMAIL_NOREPLY_ADDRESS=
    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=
    GS_BUCKET_NAME=
```
(Ask an administrator for the values)

- activate virtual environment

```
    source venv/bin/activate
```
- if virtual environment is not created yet, then follow this:

```python
    python3 -m venv venv
```

### Install dependecies
Usually, you do need install them everytime but depends on the updates, sometimes you need to return to this step

```python
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run migrations
Migrations are Django’s way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema.
Usually, you do need run them everytime but depends on the updates, sometimes you need to return to this step.

Here two commands. You should **run** them **both** as they serve two different DB's (*default* and *geocity*).
```python
    python3 manage.py migrate --database=default
```
```python
    python3 manage.py migrate --database=geocity
```

## Run server
*This is development server don't use it in production.*

Export **all** environment variables from .env file and run
```python
    python3 manage.py
```
OR

Use shortcut (recommended)

```
    source run.sh
```
If you are interested what does `run.sh` do, check [this](#runsh) out


## Admin
Admin page is located with url `http://localhost:8000/admin`

To sign in admin panel as a staff use thi credentials
```
    username: staff
    password: staf1234
```

If you want experience full-featured admin panel with full access use this credentials instead:
```
    username: demo
    password: demo
```
Aware of the [loading fixture](#loading-data) (data), unless you didn't, sign-in will be unavailable!

## Loading data
Normally, you need to do this only once. Notice here two commands:
- The first command populates *default* DB with product, review, articles, etc.
- The second command populates *geocity* DB with all geographical-related data. If something went wrong, you
should flush your DB to escape integrity issues.

#### DEFAULT DB:
⚠️ CAUTION!!!

This command will flush your database. Any changes that you made before will be unsaved.

```
    python3 manage.py loaddata user/fixtures/fixture.json
```

#### GEOCITY DB:
It may take some time. Be patient.
```
    python3 manage.py cities --import=all
```
